I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

I am starting by working through ["The Swift Programming Language"](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-5-0/id881256329) book from Apple.

## Log

**Day 1: June 5, 2019:** I have begun the introduction to Swift. We have covered the standard variables types, flow control, and the basics of functions and closures.

**Day 2: June 6, 2019:** We were introduced to classes, enums, and structs. While I know these are important in OOP, I have very little experience with them, so I made sure to understand the basics.

**Day 3: June 7, 2019:** We finished "A Swift Tour" and are now working through the language guide. The tour ended with protocols and error handling. So far, the language guide is covering the basics of variables and constants.

**Day 4: June 8, 2019:** We finished the basics of numerics, booleans, and tuples. I worked for a second hour and covered optionals and finished up the chapter on basics. I completed a third hour where I learned about the basic operators available in Swift.

**Day 5: June 9, 2019:** Began the chapter of the language guide on Strings and Characters. Among other features of Strings in Swift, I learned about Unicode characters, indexing, and adding and removing characters.
