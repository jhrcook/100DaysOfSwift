End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Auto Layout"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/6/overview). It is a purely technical exercise to learn about using Auto Layout of Xcode to make better apps. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Guess the Flag" app

**Day 1 - July 1, 2019**

I started by updating project 2, the "Guess the Flag" game, to work in landscape.
