I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["7 Swiftly Words"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/8/overview). This is a game where the player is presented with a list of hints and needs to guess the word they describe given certain provided letters. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "7 Swiftly Words" app

**Day 1 - July 3, 2019**

Finished the 7 Swiftly Words game app. I got a lot of practice in creating a layout and constraints in code (as opposed to the IB).

I finished the challeneges, which included a pop-up when a wrong answer is submitted. I included two buttons, one to clear the current answer, and another to continue with the current letters entered. There are also point removed for wrong answers, which required me to change the criteria for checking if the level was complete.
