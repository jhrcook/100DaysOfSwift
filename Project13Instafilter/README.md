I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Instafilter"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/11/overview). This app will load an image, let the user add filters, and save the image back to the library. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Instafilter" app

**Day 1 - July 11, 2019**

I got a lot of practice making a layout in code - the tutorial created it in the IB, but I found it easier, and more adaptable to build it in `viewDidLoad()`. I did run into a problem with showing the label in a `UIButton`, but figured it out by setting the `UIButton(.roundedRect)` I got a refresher on loading images from the library. Finally, I learned about the basics of Core Images.
