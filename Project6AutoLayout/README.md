I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Auto Layout"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/6/overview). It is a purely technical exercise to learn about using Auto Layout of Xcode to make better apps. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Auto Layout project

**Day 1 - July 1, 2019**

I started by updating project 2, the "Guess the Flag" game, to work in landscape.

**Day 2 - July 2, 2019**

I learned how to create a layout using Auto Layout and constraints. The example uses the safe area constrains on the leading edge (where the text is) but not the trailing edge (where there is not text to protect).
