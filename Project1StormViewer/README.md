I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) call ["Storm Viewer"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/1/overview). It creates a scrollable list of images (of storms from a national database). I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.
