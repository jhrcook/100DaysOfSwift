I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) call ["Easy Browser"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/4/overview). It creates a simple game where the player must name the country that the flag represents. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Easy Browser" app

**Day 1 - June 30, 2019**

The web view loads Google.com by default and there is a pop-up window with the option to select from 3 websites. Swipe navigation to go forwards or backwards in the history is available.
