I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Secret Swift"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/28/overview). This app is designed to teach me about using Touch ID and Face ID for securely autheticating users and how to securely store data in the Keychain. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Secret Swift" app

**Day 1 - August 13, 2019**

The base project was to create a secret text view that stored the text in Keychain. Only through biometric identifiaction (either Face ID or Touch ID) could the text be read. Another important feature was to ensure that the text was hidden if the app was navigated away from.
